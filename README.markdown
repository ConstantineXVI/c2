    Declarative visualization in Clojure(Script)


Experimental branch
===================

This is an experimental branch with changes to the ClojureScript side
of C2. The Hiccup compiler and (potentially) most direct DOM
manipulation fns will be removed in favor of a JavaScript Hiccup
implementation and a new data-binding framework.
